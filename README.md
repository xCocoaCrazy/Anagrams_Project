# How to run the project
1. On your environment make sure you have Java installed.
2. Open terminal on your OS
3. Open the folder of the project and go to *Anagrams_Project/out/artifacts/Anagrams_Project_jar/Anagrams_Project.jar* and copy the .jar's location.
4. In terminal write ```java -jar PATH_TO_JAR_FILE```

**P.S.** - if you want to add some new words to the ```words.txt``` file then you should go to *src/main/java/resources/words.txt*, edit the file and save it.
After that you should open the project in Intellij Idea by opening the ```pom.xml``` file as a project, and then go to *Build -> Build Artifacts -> Rebuild*.
